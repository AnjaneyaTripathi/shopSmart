# Shop Smart

***

With the ongoing pandemic, it's imperative that everyone remains at home and follows the correct protocols in this situation. Going outdoors should be minimized
and done only when extremely necessary. Keeping this in mind, we decided to create an online platform for daily needs and devised a solution for the same.

### Idea

*CUSTOMER*

Many platforms exist that already provide home delivery services and what not, we decided to give the consumer more flexibilty and allow him to exercise the choice
of home delivery or pick-up from the shop (in case the consumer doesn't want delivery at their doorstep). The user can select from a wide range of products that 
cater to their daily needs and place an order for the same. 

*SHOP KEEPER*

Once an order is placed, the shop owner can view the order and change the status of the delivery as per the situation. Once he has bagged the item, he can toggle
the status to 'Ready for Pick Up' which notifies the user that they can go and collect the item. Once taken, the status is toggled to 'Delivered'.

The shop keeper can change the items on the shelf and update the quantities for various products and modify their availability, price and description. 

### Technology Stack

*Frontend*: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript 

*Backend*: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB

#### Future Scope and Scaling

We plan to take this idea further and add features such as a recommendation system, push notifications (to notify the user when a certain product is available,
order is ready for pickup etc.) and enhance the UI in some locations of the site. Online payment is another aspect we are looking into at the moment. Due to time
constraints, we have implemented a very rudimentary structure and plan to enhance this website with the right motivation.
